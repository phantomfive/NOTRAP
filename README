                |         The OS Independence Layer          |
                | Freeing you from OS dependence since 2013! |
                +--------------------------------------------+

Motivation: Since each OS has it's own set if idiosyncracies, incompatibilities,
and general unfriendliness, here we present a library to abstract all that
away.

For example, snprintf() returns a different value on Windows than on Linux.
How to deal with that situation? Call the NOTRAP version of snprintf(),
NOPsnprintf(), and you are guaranteed that it will return the same value on any 
platform.
